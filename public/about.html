  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm Neha Kumari, a highly motivated and creative individual with a strong academic foundation and a passion for coding. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at Bengal College of Engineering and Technology, where I've consistently achieved excellent grades (8.21 CGPA).</p>

  <p>My interest in technology and problem-solving led me to explore the world of coding. I've honed my skills in various programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java. I've also delved into data structures and algorithms, which has strengthened my analytical and problem-solving abilities.</p>

  <p>I'm not just a coder; I'm also a creative thinker and a team player. I've actively participated in coding competitions and hackathons, where I've collaborated with others to develop innovative solutions. I've also presented my projects at various platforms like Prodigy Vidyalaya and Kerela University, showcasing my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively.</p>
  <p>Beyond academics, I'm an active member of my community. I've volunteered my time to teach coding to underprivileged children and have organized several coding workshops. I believe in using my skills to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
  <p>I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a challenging and rewarding role in the tech industry. I'm a quick learner, a dedicated worker, and I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge. I'm confident that I can be a valuable asset to any team.</p>
